DICE Lung
===========

Repo for our manuscript presenting the DICE tissue project. Check out our manuscript:
- [*Single-cell eQTL analysis of activated T cell subsets reveals activation and cell typeâ€“dependent effects of disease-risk variants*](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciimmunol.abm2508#) (PLACEHOLDER; TO BE REPLACED)

We have splitted the process in six main sections:
- Variant calling (based on WGS data)
- scRNA-seq data analysis
- scATAC-seq data analysis
- eQTL mapping
- Overlap and colocalization analyses
- GARFIELD

Below we broadly describe these sections and within the directory corresponding to each of them we describe them in extensive detail.

# Variant calling (based on WGS data)

# scRNA-seq data analysis

This process was applied to each predefined immune subset independently.
This section comprises the following major steps:
- Preprocessing of reads by mapping them to the reference genome and collapsing them into UMI count matrices (10x's cellranger)
- Donor deconvolution based on hashtag oligos (HTOs) and based on genetic variants (Demuxlet; depends on the output from the section above).
- Clustering and dimensionality reduction.
- Population definition
- Sex-biased transcript calling
- 
The first step is described in the methods section of our manuscript in detail. Here we provide the code for the rest of the steps.

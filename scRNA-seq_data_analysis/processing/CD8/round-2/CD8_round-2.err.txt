Warning messages:
1: UNRELIABLE VALUE: One of the 'future.apply' iterations ('future_lapply-1') unexpectedly generated random numbers without declaring so. There is a risk that those random numbers are not statistically sound and the overall results might be invalid. To fix this, specify 'future.seed=TRUE'.

Warning messages:
1: UNRELIABLE VALUE: One of the 'future.apply' iterations ('future_lapply-1') unexpectedly generated random numbers without declaring so. There is a risk that those random numbers are not statistically sound and the overall results might be invalid. To fix this, specify 'future.seed=TRUE'. This ensures that proper, parallel-safe random numbers are produced via the L'Ecuyer-CMRG method. To disable this check, use 'future.seed = NULL', or set option 'future.rng.onMisuse' to "ignore".
